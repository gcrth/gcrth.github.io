## Background

This manual is not a paper, but actually a manual from a company. However, this manual focus on the the principal behind the product instead of how to use the product, so it could be a good referance for people who would like to do computation with molecular.

This manual could be found via <https://daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/index.pdf>.

## Important Things when Analyzing Molecules

* cycles
* bond type, order, and aromaticity
* symmetry
* canonical labeling
* chirality

## Reactions

There are typically three roles for molecules related to a reaction.

* reactant
* agent
* product

There are some additional data important for a reaction.

* stoichiometry
* equilibrium constants
* yield
* conditions

Ideally, reactions could be represented stoichiometrically (all thing related are unambiguous). However, there are many information-deficient reactions.
