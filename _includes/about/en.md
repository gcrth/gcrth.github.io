#### Chemical Similarity Based on Map Edit Distance

07/2019~09/2019

* Accomplished the molecular classification and the molecular search with the molecular similarity, which is measured by the map edit distance (MED).
* Showed the effectiveness of the proposed MED for graph classification tasks in the area of cheminformatics through k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
* Conducted the comparison between the developed classifier and other two types of methods to investigate the effectiveness of tackling the graph classification tasks in the area of cheminformatics.

#### Generate the Molecular with Special Characteristic

12/2018~06/2019

* Adopted Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to operate directly on graph-structured data to generate molecular.
* Designed an interpretable regularizer to encourage the generation of molecule with desired properties.
* Compared with the method of generation of molecular such as: Graph based, SMILES based, and the method of generative recursive autoencoders for Shape Structures.
* Tried to find a solution for model collapse and improve the diversity of generated molecules.
